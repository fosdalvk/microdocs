        This paper argues that Haigh and Youngâ€™s definition of non-interference
        for intransitive security policies admits information flows that are not
        in accordance with the intuitions it seeks to formalise. Several
        alternative definitions are discussed, which are shown to be equivalent
        to the classical definition of noninterference with respect to
        transitive policies.  Rushby's unwinding conditions for intransitive
        noninterference are shown to be sound and complete for one of these
        definitions, TA-security.  Access control systems compatible with a
        policy are shown to be TA-secure, and it is also shown that TA-security
        implies that the system can be interpreted as an access control system.

        The design of a protection system for an oper- ating system is seen to
        involve satisfying the com- peting properties of richness and integrity.
        Achieving both requires the interplay of analysis and synthesis. Using a
        formal model from the lit- erature, three designs are developed whose
        integ- rity (with the help of the model) can be shown.

        A noninterference formulation of MLS applicable to the Secure Ada Target
