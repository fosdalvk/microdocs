==============================================

Don't use {\it foo}, {\sc foo}, {\bf foo}, {\em foo} - that's for primative \TeX.
Instead upgrade to \LaTeX and use \emph{lol}, \textit{lol}, \textbf{lol},
\textsc{lol}

Don't use \bullet for the dot product, use \cdot.

Don't exhaust \cdot.

Generally, try not to use \frac when inline, or \sfrac either.  So instead of
$\frac{1}{2}x^2$, use $x^2/2$.
